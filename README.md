# Customer-churn-analysis
About the Project:
This project is an end-to-end customer churn analysis done as part of my data science learning. The goal was to understand why customers leave a service and what a company can do to reduce churn.

Dataset:
I used a customer churn dataset (telecom-based) that contains information about customer demographics, services used, and churn status.

What I Worked On:
-Understanding the dataset and its columns
-Cleaning the data (handling missing values and data types)
-Performing exploratory data analysis to find patterns
-Analyzing churn behaviour
-Writing business-oriented recommendations based on insights
-Creating a basic Streamlit app to visualize the results

This was my first time working with Streamlit.

Tools & Libraries Used:
-Python
-Pandas & NumPy
-Matplotlib & Seaborn
-Streamlit

Conclusion
Through this project, I learned how to approach a real-world data problem, analyze customer behaviour, and translate insights into business recommendations.
